"""Cook with Chef without a Chef Server

With LittleChef you will be able to get started more quickly cooking with
Chef_, the excellent Configuration Management System.

You will just need your local (preferably version controled) kitchen with all
your cookbooks, roles data bags and nodes, which will get rsynced to a node
each time you start a Chef Solo configuration run with the bundled 'fix'
command.

It also adds features to Chef Solo that are currently only available for Chef
Server users: data bag search, and node search.
