====================
LittleChef Changelog
====================

Version 1.1.0 January 3, 2012
----------------------------------------
New features
* #72: Plugin mini-framework. Moved save_ip command to a plugin
* New ssh command
* --verbose option (Chef 0.10.6+). Default is false, and will not show the
    "Processing" output any more. Chef Solo will only log what has changed

Bugs fixed:
* Fixes paramiko dependency by moving to new fabric's fork "ssh"
* Make "list_nodes_with_recipe" and "list_nodes_with_role" respect the --env option
    Also, they now use the expanded run_list


Version 1.0.4 November 14, 2011
----------------------------------------
New features
* Make "list_nodes" respect the --env option
* Accept --env=ENV in addition to --env ENV


Version 1.0.3 November 11, 2011
----------------------------------------
New features
* #15 (partly): Automatic metadata.json regeneration from metadata.rb
* #63: cleonte contributed deploy_chef support for CentOS/RHEL v6
* #70: Markus added Chef Solo logs (found on /var/log/chef/solo.log)
* Made debug and env proper command line options instead of fake fabric tasks

Bugs fixed:
* #67: Andrew fixed `get_ips` for OSX by adding a regex to parse IPs
* #66: Remove sensible data from a node after a configuration run


Version 1.0.2 October 11, 2011
----------------------------------------
* NEW #61: Added the command option "env"
* NEW #60: Don't force to define a password if ssh-config is used

* FIX #62: Cristi fixed rpm installation by using the FrameOS RBEL repository
* FIX: Automatic node data bag created items with the hostname as the name.
    That can lead to name collitions. Now FQDN with underscores is used instead


Version 1.0.1 September 28, 2011
----------------------------------------
* NEW #58: Markus added operation "nodes_with_role", which configures all nodes with
    the given role

* FIX #57: Eivind added deploy_chef support for Arch Linux
* FIX: Transform "true" and "false" strings from into real True and False values
    happens with default values from metadata.json attributes


Version 1.0.0 September 21, 2011
----------------------------------------
* NEW #46: Markus implemented node synching using rsync instead of data upload,
    substantially speeding up node configuration runs. All cookbooks are now
    synchronized, instead of only those needed by the configuration run
* NEW #16: Markus implemented search support for data bags
* NEW #16: Automatically add a "node" data bag, which allows for node search.
    It contains everything defined in each nodes/mynode.json file, plus "recipes"
    (expanded recipe list), "role" (roles in the run_list),
    "roles" (expanded role list), merged attributes (from cookbook, node and roles)
    and some Chef automatic attributes
* NEW: Add ipaddress attribute to a node after a configuration run. That way the IP
    of that node will be available in the node data bag and thus in the node search
* NEW #53: tow added a patch that allows to override distro detection when installing
    Chef Solo
* NEW #55: Markus added a library file that allows to set "chef_environment" in a
    role or node attribute
* NEW: Changed "cook" command to "fix", so that we don't collide with the executable
    name of an existing package. This was done so that LittleChef can be distro-packaged
* NEW #54: Multi-node execution: a list of nodes to be configured can now be given.
    The nodes will be configured preserving order
* NEW: Removed "configure" command. It will be assumed to be the desired action if
    no other command is given. Just typing "fix node:X" will configure node X


Version 0.6.5 July 5, 2011
----------------------------------------
* FIX: list_recipes didn't show cookbooks that were *only* present in site-cookbooks
